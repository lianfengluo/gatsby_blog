**See following example:**
![fiber tree](fiber-tree.png)
The fiber is using link list.
***
`child`, `sibling` and `return` is the next link list element;
***
Fiber node structure:
```js
{
    stateNode: new ClickCounter,
    type: ClickCounter,
    alternate: null,
    key: null,
    updateQueue: null,
    memoizedState: {count: 0},
    pendingProps: {},
    memoizedProps: {},
    tag: 1,
    effectTag: 0,
    nextEffect: null
}
```
There are 4 main functions that are used to traverse the tree and initiate or complete the work:

1. performUnitOfWork
2. beginWork
3. completeUnitOfWork
4. completeWork

To demonstrate how they are used, take a look at the following animation of
![work loop](./workloop.gif)
Using **dfs** to do the work. It will keep processing the next sibling after children node is completed.
